👋 Hi, I’m Rohan — I tinker, build, and sometimes break things on purpose… because that’s how the best ideas emerge. From AI-driven platforms to decision systems, I’m drawn to projects that actually move the needle.

Now → Next — Leveling up in AI systems design, risk modeling, and economic analysis. I’m preparing for a future where tech, markets, and global systems don’t just change — they accelerate.

What I’m Working On — Building AI for financial decision-making, risk modeling, and economic systems, with an eye on the long game: sustainable infrastructure, energy transitions, cybersecurity, and the shifting geopolitics of technology.

Life Outside Code — I’ve called Mumbai, Delhi, and Toronto home. When I’m not buried in algorithms, you’ll find me at CrossFit, cycling long distances, running marathons, or deep in a thriller movie. I’m also fascinated by defence tech, political science, and how machine learning is reshaping BFSI.

Let’s Connect — 📫 rohanchatrath1@gmail.com — Always up for swapping ideas, debating big questions, or building something that changes the game.
