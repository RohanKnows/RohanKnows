ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan â€” I tinker, build, and sometimes break things on purposeâ€¦ because thatâ€™s how the best ideas emerge. From AI-driven platforms to decision systems, Iâ€™m drawn to projects that actually move the needle.

Now â†’ Next â€” Leveling up in AI systems design, risk modeling, and economic analysis. Iâ€™m preparing for a future where tech, markets, and global systems donâ€™t just change â€” they accelerate.

What Iâ€™m Working On â€” Building AI for financial decision-making, risk modeling, and economic systems, with an eye on the long game: sustainable infrastructure, energy transitions, cybersecurity, and the shifting geopolitics of technology.

Life Outside Code â€” Iâ€™ve called Mumbai, Delhi, and Toronto home. When Iâ€™m not buried in algorithms, youâ€™ll find me at CrossFit, cycling long distances, running marathons, or deep in a thriller movie. Iâ€™m also fascinated by defence tech, political science, and how machine learning is reshaping BFSI.

Letâ€™s Connect â€” ðŸ“« rohanchatrath1@gmail.com â€” Always up for swapping ideas, debating big questions, or building something that changes the game.
