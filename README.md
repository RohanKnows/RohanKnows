# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan

Iâ€™m exploring how data can make sense of complex systems â€” especially in finance, risk, and policy.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on applying data science in the BFSI domain:  
credit, fraud, churn, risk â€” decisions that actually move money and matter to people.

But my lens is shaped by more than just code.  
Iâ€™m drawn to history, economics, and strategic studies â€” fields that shape how I think about data, decisions, and the systems behind them.

I care about:  
- Modeling uncertainty in the real world  
- The messy intersection of data, power, and human behavior  
- Building things that are both technically solid and intellectually honest

Learning in public. Building slowly. Connecting dots.
