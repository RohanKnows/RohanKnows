A little about me:

I’m often confused, which makes me curious — so I learn by doing. I’m drawn to machine learning, finance, and the math that connects them.

Most days, you’ll find me coding late, coffee in hand. I’m interested in the future of AI, platform companies, and what they make possible.

Outside of work, I’m into thrillers, history, and getting outdoors — snorkeling, cycling, hiking, or just exploring somewhere new.
