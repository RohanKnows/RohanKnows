This is where I tinker, build, and break things until they work â€” from AI-driven platforms to decision systems that actually move the needle.

Now â†’ Next --
Deepening skills in AI systems design, risk modeling, and economic analysis â€” preparing for a future where technology, markets, and global systems evolve at exponential speed.

What I Work On --
Advancing AI for financial decision-making, risk modeling, and economic systems â€” with a long-term focus on sustainable infrastructure, energy transitions, cybersecurity, and the evolving geopolitics of technology.

Life Outside Code --
Lived in Mumbai, Delhi, and Toronto. Into CrossFit, long-distance cycling, and marathons; big on thriller movies, fascinated by defence tech, political science, and machine learningâ€™s role in BFSI.
