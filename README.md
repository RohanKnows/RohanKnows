• I’m often confused, which only makes me curious — so I just do.
• Drawn to machine learning, finance, and the math that holds them together.
• You’ll usually find me with coffee in hand, vibe-coding late into the night.
• I get excited about the future of AI, platform companies, and what they unlock.
• Beyond that, I lose myself in thrillers, adventures, traveling, and the histories and cultures that shaped us.
